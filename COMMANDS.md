## 04_06 - The Rails Console

##### Note: These commands allows for extracting the need to use complex sql statements that would be imbeded in PHP code. For large scale whie indepth business logic in overly used without the code structure.  


```bash
rails c 
```
```ruby
> User.first
> Company.first
> Project.first
> u = User.new
> u.fname = "Brian"
> u.lname = "Hoke"
> u.save
> u
> c = Company.new
> c.name = "Bently Hoke"
> c.save
> u.company = c
> u.save
> u.company
> u.company.name
> c.users
> c.users.first
> c.users.first.fname
> exit
```

```bash
rails c 
```

```ruby
> u

```
## 04_08-Many-To-Many Associations - Testing Via The Console

```

## 04_14-Scopes

#### Scopes are useful to place queries that done repeative over and over again. 

```bash
$ rails c
```
```ruby 
> Work.all
> Work.fullday
> exit
```
```bash
$ rails c
```
```ruby 
> Work.recent
> Work.recent.size
>
```

## 04_15-Validations

#### Validations make you rails apps database-agnostic. Allowng the capacity of rails app to function with any vendorâ€™s database management system (DBMS).

```bash
$ rails c
```

```ruby 
> p = Project.new
> p.save
> p.errors
> p.name = "Some New Project"
> c = Company.first
> p.company = c
> p.save
> p.delete
> p = Project.new
> p.save
> p
> p.valid?
> p.name = "Some New Project2"
> c = Company.last
> p.company = c
> p.valid?
> p.save
> exit
```

```bash
$ rails c
```

```ruby 
> w = Work.new
> w.save
> w.errors
> w.hours = 'a'
> w.save
> w.errors
> w.hours = 0
> w.save
> c = Project.last
> w.project = c
> w.user = User.last
> w.hours = 2.5
> w.save
> w.errors
> w.hours = 2
> w.save
```

Reference the git log for the files that were added and modified.

## 05_04-Generating Controllers - Exercise Review

Adding Controllers

Add controllers, with index and show actions, for projects and for works

1. "rails g controller projects" (do the same for wors)

2. add routes for "projects" and "works"

3. create "index" and "show" actions in the controller for "projects" and for "works"

4. create "index.html.erb" and "show.html.erb" view templates for "projects" and for "works"

5. test it out: "rails s" from the command line

```bash
rails g controller projects
rails g controller works
```
After the view s and controller are filled in, run the following command:

```bash
rails s
```


## 05_05-Adding To Our Controllers And Routes

Added a root route to companies#index; this allows anyone to go to homepage without knowing any of controller or actions

Add named route by providing a way to get to the work's index action: 

```ruby
get 'recentworks/:days' => 'works#index'
```
for seach engine we can embed (named route) urls or historial reasons with old application can use this to not break any old references

There are always to direct the action methods to use a particular model method base on the params passed with in the the controller.

```bash
rails s
```
